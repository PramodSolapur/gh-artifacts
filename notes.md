#### Jobs Artifacts

job artifacts are files or directories that you choose to save (upload) from one job so they can be downloaded later, either:
- 游닌 By another job in the same workflow
- 游닌 Manually from the GitHub Actions UI
- 游닌 Via the GitHub API or CLI
They are temporary storage for passing build/test output, logs, binaries, reports, etc.



#### Where do the files go?
They are:

- Uploaded to GitHub's temporary artifact storage
- Scoped to this specific workflow run
- Available for download by other jobs in the same run
- Downloadable manually from the "Actions" tab in the GitHub UI

#### Job Outputs?

job outputs are values that a job can produce and pass to other jobs in the same workflow.
They are used when you want to:
- 游대 Pass data from one job to another (e.g., a version number, file path, build URL)
- 游뚽 Make conditional decisions in downstream jobs
- 游눠 Share information without needing to write/read files or artifacts

Basic Concept:
- One job sets an output
- Another job that needs: it can read that output using ${{ needs.job_id.outputs.output_name }}
